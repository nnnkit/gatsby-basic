Gatsby gives plugins and site builders many APIs for controlling your site.

# Async plugins

If your plugin performs async operations (disk I/O, database access, calling remote APIs, etc.) you must either return a promise or use the callback passed to the 3rd argument. Gatsby needs to know when plugins are finished as some APIs, to work correctly, require previous APIs to be complete first. See Debugging Async Lifecycles for more info.

Learning react, redux is something I am going to do this year.

## Code in react

```js
var name = "Hello";
```
