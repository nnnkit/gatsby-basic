# Third Post

Gatsby has a great guide for upgrading from v1 to v2. This post describes how I upgraded this site from v1 to v2. If it reads almost identically to their official guide, it's because their guide is awesome. if it doesn't, their guide is still awesome.

Before I got started, I created a new branch in git where all changed would live. This branch will get merged into the master branch after this post ðŸ’ª.

Remove `gatsby-link` from your `package.json`

You no longer need the gatsby-link package. Everything that used to be there now lives in the main gatsby dependency. We will adjust our imports later to reflect this change.

## Code in react

```js
import React from "react";
```
